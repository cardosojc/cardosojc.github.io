My name is Jos√© Cardoso.

- I like to solve complex problems with software, no matter the technology is. The use-case chooses the stack, not the other way around. My experience inclues:
  - Microservices architectures
  - Mobile development (Nativescript and React Native)
  - Cloud

- I love my family, and yes pets are part of it.
