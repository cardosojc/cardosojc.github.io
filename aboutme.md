My name is Jos√© Cardoso.

- I like to solve complex problems with software, no matter the technology is. The use-case chooses the stack, not the other way around. My experience includes:
  - Microservices architectures
  - Mobile development (Nativescript and React Native)
  - Cloud
- Currently i'm helping some non-profit instituitons with software solutions that will help them answer better to day-to-day challenges
- I love my family, and yes my Pets are part of it.
